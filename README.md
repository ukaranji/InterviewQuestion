# Front End interview

We have a very basic sign-up form written in React that we'd like you to flesh out.  We have the following fieldsâ€¦
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Phone number
4. User name
5. Password
6. Date of Birth

...and a submit button.

We'd like you to do the following:
1. Connect this to our backend service that will either accept or reject the signup: https://react-interview-question-backend-evdphnararfqcvcm.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net
    - The service expects a json body that will conforms to the spec described here: <insert swagger url>
2. Implement validation for each field
    - Names should not contain numbers or special characters
    - Phone number should have 10 digits
    - The date of birth must be that of someone who is at 18 years of age and born after December 31st, 1899
    - User name must be at least 8 characters, start with a letter and not have special characters.
    - Password should be between 8 and 18 characters, and must contain each of the following
        - An upper-case letter
        - A lower-case letter
        - A number
3. Provide some kind of feedback to the user if their input is invalid or rejected.
   - Bonus: identify what field or fields are invalid and why.
